     * ah, this can't be used because this must be specific to a file...
     * we really could have one for each file
     * maybe have this be an option, if enabled we have one page_tracker for each bucket
     * each with n_pages of designated memory
     * this way we can leverage the page tracker between calls
     * this could speed up consecutive insertions significantly
     * i'll add
     * struct page_tracker* page_trackers;
     * this is optionally initialized in init_diskmap()
     * if the seting is turned off, we'll just use it within insertions
     * otherwise, we'll use our idx's specific page_tracker
     *
     *
     * honestly not sure how big a benefit this will be because page_tracker is the most helpful for very large
     * files and for these files, we'll need to adjust the window being used anyway - especially because
     * we'll finish an insertion with the window at the end of our file
     * and next call it'll be shifted to the start. yep, probably not worth it.
     *
     * it may help for many consecutive insertions but my hunch is that duplicate checking renders it pretty much
     * useless
